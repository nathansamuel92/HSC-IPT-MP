# HSC Information, Processes and Technology (IPT) - Major Project

<p>
Inspired by the challenge, I was sure to bring all my passion to this subjectâ€”a full mock systems development life cycle iteration, including an extensive feasibility report and a working system prototype. Throughout this project, I topped my grade with high-distinction marks. A project of such nature required proper planning, which I was able to adhere to and complete this project swiftly.

Naturally, during the completion of this report, I gained competency in:
- The Development Life Cycle
- System Modelling and Diagramming
- Report Writing & Professional Project Scheduling
- Feasibility Study
- Systems Security Modelling

During the completion of my prototype, I gained competency in:
- SQL Development & Entity Relationship Modelling
- Microsoft Access Development
- Database Configuration
- Database Security
- Microsoft Visual Basic
